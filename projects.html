          Division of Neonatal and Developmental Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, Stanford
          </p>
          <p>
          Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is used as a bedside technology in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) for non-invasive monitoring of regional tissue oxygenation in vulnerable babies.  As such, we have routinely monitored brain and kidney oxygen levels for the first week of life in over 500 infants over the past 5+ years.  These NIRS datafiles are a rich repository for research questions to help premature and critically ill babies in the NICU.  Several projects are available involving development of an algorithm to concatenate, process, and summarize NIRS data with an emphasis on data integrity.  Development of a graphical user interface for future work is a potential goal.

          Department of Radiology, Stanford
          </p>
          <p>
          Although radiology images, such as MRI, are very useful to identify suspicious lesions, tissue samples from biopsy or surgery, remain the only way to diagnose cancer. A pathologist visually inspects the histopathology images of the tissue sample and assesses the presence of cancer, thereby diagnosing the disease, and categorizes its aggressiveness by providing a grade. There is a need to automate the diagnosis and grading of prostate cancer on histopathology images to limit the subject interpretation of images and allow for high throughput annotation of histopathology images. This project will use public data release as part of a MICCAI challenge and will focus on developing deep learning methods to distinguish different grades of prostate cancer based on histopathology images. The dataset includes 244 images with Gleason grades regional labels provided by 6 pathologists. Data and additional information: https://gleason2019.grand-challenge.org/

          Department of Radiology, Stanford
          </p>
          <p>
          Despite technical advancements in the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer, it remains the most common and the second most deadly cancer in men in US [1]. MRI plays an essential role in the diagnosis of prostate cancer, yet the radiologists’ interpretation of the MRI images has a relatively high sensitivity, 0.85-0.95, yet a reduced specificity, 0.71-0.75, to detect prostate cancer. There is a need to develop advanced machine learning methods to accurately detect cancer on MRI. This project will use public data released as part of the prostateX challenge and will focus on developing deep learning methods to distinguish benign conditions (non-cancer) from cancer on multi-parametric MRI. The training dataset includes 204 patients with 331 findings categorized as cancer or benign.

          </p>
          <p>
          There is an urgent need for the development of biomarkers of chronic pain to better predict (1) the best treatment response for an individual patient; and (2) whether a person’s pain will improve or worsen over time. We have been developing neuroimaging-based biomarkers of chronic pain and amassed a large dataset of brain and spinal cord neuroimaging scans of people with chronic pain and matched healthy controls. There are multiple projects involving the use of traditional and machine learning approaches for the development of prediction models. We ultimately wish to translate this knowledge into clinical decision support tools to realize the vision of precision pain medicine where can provide the best treatment for a particular patient under a specific circumstance. For those interested in applying to medical school or a health related PhD program, we have a long experience with providing shadowing at the Stanford Pain Management Center. We can help with applications and have a long track record in helping students get accepted into these programs. Furthermore, plenty of opportunities for students to either lead or participate in projects leading to a manuscript publication.

          Division of Pain Medicine, Department of Anesthesiology, Perioperative and Pain Medicine, Stanford
          </p>
          <p>
          Chronic pain is an astounding problem affecting 100 million Americans and costing our country half a trillion dollars per year. One of the major challenges in understanding and treating pain is the need for better quality data. To address this problem, the National Academy of Medicine (NAM) called for the development of learning healthcare systems (LHSs) which bring together clinicians, scientists, and patients work together to capture high-quality data. In essence, to turn our clinics into research labs where every patient encounter is deeply characterized. To answer this call from the NAM, we developed CHOIR (http://choir.stanford.edu) as an open-source (free) LHS. Since its introduction in 2012, we have collected many 10’s of thousands of baseline and longitudinal data on real-world patients with pain (and other health conditions). We have also implemented CHOIR in multiple academic institutions in the US, Canada and Israel. Our ultimate goal is to realize the vision of precision pain medicine where can provide the best treatment for the particular patient under a specific circumstance. Furthermore, all development efforts serve to benefit the other clinical specialties also using CHOIR. Multiple projects including machine learning, data visualization and platform development are provided in the apply link.

          <p>
          Normal weight individuals with type 2 diabetes (NWD) have higher risk of mortality than overweight or obese individuals. NWD may have less lean muscle mass in proportion to adipose tissue, which may contribute to this higher risk of mortality. Strength training increases muscle mass rather than reducing body weight and can combat the age-related shiftin body composition that results in higher fat massand decreased muscle mass (i.e., sarcopenia). Thus,strength training may therefore be helpful for NWD rather than weight loss, as is recommended for overweight/obese individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2DM).The goal of the Strength Training Regimen fOr Normal weiGht Diabetics (STRONG-D) Study is to determine the best exercise regimen for NWD, who experience greater mortality than overweight/obese diabetics. Patients are randomized into one of three arms: Strength, Aerobic, or Combo. This lab offers opportunities to conduct patient clinical visits, author papers and grants, and more.

          <p>
          How many opioid pills should a doc prescribe for a patient in pain after back surgery or kneereplacement?  Does it vary by gender or age?  Opioids have run rampant in the US with some US states reporting more opioid prescriptions each year than residents.  In 2016, over 64,000 Americans died from overdoses, 21 percent more than the almost 53,000 in 2015.  If not remediated, public health experts estimate that nationwide over 500,000 people could die from the epidemic over the next 10 years.
          <br>
          How can we ensure the safe and effective prescribing of one of the most effective medicines doctors have?  We seek to inform the current discussion on opioid prescribing guidelines by using a range of analytic techniques to explore the relationship between pre-surgical patient characteristics, opioid use profiles and adverse opioid outcomes.

          <p>
          Post-operative wound infections occur between 2% and 15%, depending on the surgery. This is considered a “never-event” and CMS does not reimbursethe treatment of such complications- similar to re-admissions which occur within 30-days of a procedure. There is great benefit to identifying signs of infection early for early intervention before the typical 1-week follow up. We have an IRB approved study to collect photos from wounds from post-op day 0 through post-op day 7 which we label and have the ability to run computer vision algorithms on. In addition to early wound infection detection we are very very interested in the art of taking a photo and converting that to a “structured report” that we would use for documentation in the electronic medical record asthis is what is critical for billing. In addition we have the opportunity to gain access to daily photos of patients in the ICU as well as in their rooms to automate the process of generating structured reports for documentation. An example would be, “Patientis asleep, intubated with naso-gastric tube in place.”<br>Two quarter minimum engagement (Summer internship an option)

          We are several years into developing a mobile research app to study and clinically validate activity tracking using a patient’s personal mobile device +/- a smart watch. In addition to getting passive daily activity data (max steps without stopping,total daily steps, flights climbed) we also have high frequency (100Hz) raw accelerometer data and heart rate data for 6-minute walk tests in well characterized patients pre- and post- interventions. We are looking for 1) response curves in activity patterns to interventions, 2) characteristics in passive metrics relative to clinical state, and 3) correlation of passive activity to 6-minute-walk-test results among other things. We have data not only form our own studies here but also from a collaborative study with a large pharmaceutical company.<br>Two quarter minimum engagement (Summer internship an option)

          <p>
          Zap Surgical Systems, Inc. is a San Carlos, CA-based developer and manufacturer of a new generation of stereotactic radiosurgery systems. Zap Surgical Systems set out to create a first-of-its-kind therapeutic radiation technology that would be “self-shielded” and not require a radiation therapy vaultunder most circumstances. Another critical company goal was to invent a device that met or exceeded thebest quality standards of existing radiosurgical instruments, i.e. there would be no compromise in terms of performance. It remains the goal of Zap Surgical Systems to provide the above revolutionary technology at the lowest possible price; the general benchmark the company has set for itself is that the cost of ownership worldwide should be approximately one-third the cost of competing radiosurgical modalities.Zap is engaged in active research on new uses for stereotactic radiosurgery. One of these is “radiomodulation,” precise, noninvasive modulation of dysfunctional brain circuits.

          <p>
          Care of patients with burns is highly specialized and yet initial evaluation and triage of burn patients typically occurs in centers without available burn expertise. We have assembled the largest curated dataset of burn images that have been segmented and classified by experts. During last year’s CS231n we mentored a student who developed a pixel-lever classifier to evaluate burn size and depth. Our future work includes at least two opportunities: (1) develop a classifier for normal unburned skin, whichwill result in a clinically useful tool that could have exciting implications for initial treatment of these critically ill patients and (2) evaluate the effect of skin tone on performance of our classifier,whether underrepresentation of certain skin tones introduces bias and impairs performance of the classifier for certain patients, and explore opportunitiesto enhance performance for underrepresented groups.While we cannot provide computer science expertise,we worked very closely with our student last year to provide medical subject matter expertise, which resulted in a successful project that currently is in preparation for submission to a medical journal.
